## WForest GUI Library (Monogame/FNA)

WForest (W stands for Widgets) is a hobby project to tinker with monogame. I wanted to try my hand on a GUI library for games
inspired by the typical web/mobile frontend frameworks.
 
It's based on the idea of having trees of components (widgets) and properties.
Having multiple menus as trees of widgets makes it a forest üòÅ

### Version (0.0.16)
It's currently a WIP, it's usable only for basic stuff for now. 
I plan to release a *0.1* version only when I'm confident it can be used
for highly customizable stuff.

As of now it only has a simple tree collection for widgets, 
several properties to associate to widgets (mostly layout), 
a container widget (to just use as row/col), 
an ImageButton widget (it uses texture2D) with normal, hovering and pressed textures 
a Block widget which is a basic colored 
rectangle and a Text widget which can be customized through the FontSize and FontFamily properties. 
Widgets are inheritable to create custom ones, as well as the properties, 
but the core idea to create complex widgets is to do it by building a tree of widgets and props.

### How to use it
Coming soon with version 0.1...

If you really want to try it out, clone this project, add it to your project (the .FNA.csproj for fna games)
and reference it.
